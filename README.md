# IFD Milestone Project for Codeinstitute Full Stack Course

I have created this map search page for my codeinstitue fullstack development course, making use of interactive front-end development techniques.

## Criteria

Guideleines from the Codeinstitute:

CREATE A SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON ONE OR MORE APIS

Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination.

You'll want help your users:
Select a destination city
Find tourist attractions
Find accommodation
Find bars and restaurants
Provide search results in a manner that is visually appealing for your user (by drawing on the skills you have learned in User-Centric Frontend Development)

## Overview

Users can navigate to this page and simply search a destination city anywhere around the world, either directly, or by country first. The map will then populate with
nearby points of interest and the user can use the radio buttons to filter this further.
The list of map markers will be shown in the results below the map so they can see the names of the places quickly and use this to corss-check the markers where they
are placed on the map.

## Target Audience and Functionality

Target audience is anyone who is thinking of booking a holiday/trip or already has. It will be useful for first time travellers and also experienced ones as it is 
simple to use and the information provided is easily accesible. Taking stress out of browsing forums and googling venues individually.

## Mockup/Wireframes

For the design process I used **ADOBE XD** to create a simple wireframe mockup that can be veiwed below.



## Styling

I opted to try and keep the styling as simple as possible and easy to look at whilst still maintaining good functionality and presence.



Mobile first responsive design was used implementing bootstrap where necessary for all pages to ensure fluid movements on various screen sizes and this was tested in the chrome dev tools and on my own android smartphone.


## Challenges



## Testing


 For the testing phase I used my own desktop PC with various browsers and my android smartphone.
 
 I tested the responsive of the design by re-sizing the browser windows on the desktop as one of my challenges I faced was ensuring that the video would maintain its aspect ratio (16:9) when being re-sized on various screens.
 
 I used the criteria below:
 
 

Browser | Country Dropdown | Search Box | Map | Radio Buttons | Map Markers | 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
**Chrome** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
**Firefox** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
**Edge** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
**Opera** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
**Safari** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
**Mobile** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
