# IFD Milestone Project for Codeinstitute Full Stack Course

## Criteria

Guideleines from the Codeinstitute:



## Overview

 

## Target Audience and Functionality



## Mockup/Wireframes

For the design process I used **ADOBE XD** to create some simple wireframe mockups that can be veiwed below.



## Styling

I opted to try and keep the styling as simple as possible and easy to look at whilst still maintaining good functionality and presence.



Mobile first responsive design was used implementing bootstrap where necessary for all pages to ensure fluid movements on various screen sizes and this was tested in the chrome dev tools and on my own android smartphone.


## Challenges



## Testing


 For the testing phase I used my own desktop PC with various browsers and my android smartphone.
 
 I tested the responsive of the design by re-sizing the browser windows on the desktop as one of my challenges I faced was ensuring that the video would maintain its aspect ratio (16:9) when being re-sized on various screens.
 
 I used the criteria below:
 
 *Functions* - Ensuring the navbar and internal exploration worked
 
 *Links* - All links go to correct pages with a new window if it's an external page
 
 *Contact* - That the contact form only progresses with correct input
 
 *Audio* - That the audio playback and audio controls all work
 
 *Video* - That the video plays and the controls all work
 

Browser | Functions | Links | Contact | Audio | Video
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
**Chrome** | 
**Firefox** | 
**Edge** | 
**Opera** | 
**Safari** | 
**Mobile** |
